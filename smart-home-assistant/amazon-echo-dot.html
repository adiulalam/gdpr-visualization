Amazon Echo Dot
Amazon Echo Dot is an assistant meant to provide services to the user. 
The smart home assistant uses microphone to listen to the user’s query, afterwards uses the cloud service on their platform to then process the query, and finally outputs the result via the speaker. 
The Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Generation) was released in 2018 and the price is £39.99 on Amazon as of 20th of March 2021.
<br>
The Google Home Mini has a rounded circular cylinder shape which is also made from mesh grilled casing. 
The Google Home Mini also has 4 led on the top and shows up when turned on. The led is to indicate interactivity and processing. 
The device has only 1 physical button which is to control microphone. 
<br>
The Amazon Echo Dot uses micro usb cable to power on and both needs to connect to Wi-Fi to functions. 
The device allows other smart IoT devices such as smart lighting and smart camera to be connected to them. 
This means that the user can interact with the assistance which will then interact with other IoT device. 
The assistance can also interact with other 3rd party services and API such as Spotify and Weather services which allows more functionalities and interaction from the assistance.
